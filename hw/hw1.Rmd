## Instructions

1. Submit your solution on Canvas as a pdf file before *September 11 at 11:59pm*.
2. Use R for all computation, and include your code. 
3. We recommend you start with the template `hw1.Rmd` file on Canvas.

## Rubric

* [30 points] One problem below will be graded for,
  - [15 points] Correctness. Are all parts answered correctly?
  - [15 points] Clarity. Are all answers justified? For questions with a coding
  component, is code provided, and is it readable?
* [20 = 4 * 5 points] Four problems below will be graded on completeness.
* Total: 50 points

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

## Problems

**1. [DAE 1.3]** Suppose that you want to compare the growth of garden flowers
with different conditions of sunlight, water, fertilizer, and soil conditions.
Complete steps 1 - 3 of the guidelines for designing experiments in Section 1.4.
This is an open-ended question -- there is no one right answer -- just explain
your thought process.

**2. [DAE 1.8 / MED 1.5]**

  a. What is replication? Why do we need replication in an
  experiment? 
  b. Present an example that illustrates the difference between
  replication and repeated measurements. 
  c. State whether or not replication in your example would have any
  nonstatistical disadvantages, such as a considerable increase in the cost of
  running the experiment.

**3. [DAE 1.9, modified]**

  a. Why is randomization important in an experiment? 
  b. Give one example where complete randomization would be difficult or
  unethical^[The field of observational causal inference exists for drawing
  conclusions in this case, but it is out of scope for our class.].

**4. [MED, 1.4, modified]** An experiment with a single factor and two levels, 1 and
2, was used, and the results were as follows:

```{r}
df <- tibble(
  "sample_id" = as.factor(seq(10)),
  "1" = c(6.1, 8.2, 7.3, 8.4, 8.0, 7.6, 8.7, 9.3, 6.8, 7.5),
  "2" = c(6.3, 8.0, 7.7, 8.1, 8.6, 7.2, 8.4, 9.7, 6.8, 7.2)
)
```

  a. Make two histograms, one for when factor 1 was used, another for when factor
  2 was used.
  
  b. Plot the data with the sample ID as the $x$-axis, the measured value as the
  $y$-axis, and the factor level as the color of the point.
  
  c. What does part (b) tell you about the need for blocking? Is it needed -- why
  or why not?
    
**5. [MED 1.15]** Assume that an experiment with four levels of a single factor
was run, and the value of the response variable was almost strictly increasing
during the runs of the experiment. What would you suspect and what would be your
recommendation?

## Feedback

a. How much time did you spend on this homework?
b. Which problem did you find most valuable?
